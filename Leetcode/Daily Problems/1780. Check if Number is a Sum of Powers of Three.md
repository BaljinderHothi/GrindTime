# Problem
Given an integer n, return true if it is possible to represent n as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return false.

An integer y is a power of three if there exists an integer x such that y == 3x.

Example 1:

Input: n = 12
Output: true
Explanation: 12 = 31 + 32
Example 2:

Input: n = 91
Output: true
Explanation: 91 = 30 + 32 + 34
Example 3:

Input: n = 21
Output: false

# Thoughts
at some point the power of three will be greater so we can stop computing when 3^k > n

we can use backtracking here to solve this problem

we will solve this recursively

can use a parameter i to check which power we are currently at

it can be something like

                i = 0
               / \
              1   0
                 / \
                3   0

we can also do a greedy algorithm here to find the largest possible 3 power that works and work our way backwards, greedy is more optimal too

## Recursive backtracking:

class Solution:
    def checkPowersOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        def backtrack(i, cur):
            if cur == n:
                return True
            if cur > n or 3**i > n:
                return False
            if backtrack(i+1, cur + 3**i):
                return True
            return backtrack(i+1, cur)
        return backtrack(0,0)

### Time and space
Time Complexity: 
O(n^log3(2))
Space Complexity: 
O(logn)


## Greedy algo 

class Solution:
    def checkPowersOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        i = 0
        while 3**(i+1) <= n:
            i+=1
        while i >= 0:
            power = 3**i
            if power <= n:
                n-= power
            if power <= n:
                return False
            i -= 1
        return n == 0

Time Complexity: O(logn)

Space Complexity: O(1)
